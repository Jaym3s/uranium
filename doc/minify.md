# Minify #

  We provide a minifier script so that you can combine just the widgets you need. This is recommended if you're only using one or two widgets. Don't expect a drastic reduction in size -- 6 KB (gzipped) is a pretty hard floor. If you're not worried about size, we provide static minified files that include all the widgets.

    + we use Google Closure
    + bundle just what you use
    + we also support bundling with xui (recommended)
    + will also support different xui versions (for code compatability and for device compatibility)
