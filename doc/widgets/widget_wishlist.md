# Wishlist #
  
Widgets that may be coming soon / that we might tryout:

-  Image Carousel (beta)
-  Image Gallery -- made from 2 carousels and a toggler?
-  Map (w points)
-  Tabs
-  Pages (like jqtouch)
-  Updater (e.g. list of thumbnails that update the main image source)
-  Floater
-  Lateloader ?? Does this make sense to do? Maybe for us (since the ajax url is likely static), what about other people?
-  Mask ? (Appears on touch, goes away on event)
-  Validators? 
-  Simple Carousel :: maybe its an auto-degraded version based on user agent
-  360 degree view widget


# Widget Features Wishlist

-  Auto scroll timing on existing carousel
