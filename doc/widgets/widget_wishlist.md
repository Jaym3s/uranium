  Widgets that may be coming soon / that we might tryout:

  	  - Image Carousel
  	  - Image Gallery
	  - Map (w points)
	  - Tabs
	  - Pages (like jqtouch)
	  - Updater (e.g. list of thumbnails that update the main image source)
	  - Floater
	  - Lateloader ?? Does this make sense to do? Maybe for us (since the ajax url is likely static), what about other people?
	  - Mask ? (Appears on touch, goes away on event)
	  - Validators?
